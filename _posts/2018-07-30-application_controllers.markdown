Up until now, while there have been many challenges in my coding journey, in terms of learning, moving into the concept of the Application Controller, by far has been the most daunting.

Previously, concepts and actions seemed fairly linear and straight forward to me.  Even when learning about SQL, even with all the various Interrelations, it still seemed straight forward.  I think that while obviously figuring out the specifics of the Interrelations could be challenging, the concept was still simple to understand - even though the problems were challenging to solve.  

Hopefully that explanation makes sense.

Moving into Application Controllers, it's as if we took those challenging problems and interrelations, and applied them not just to tables, but to everything.  

WIth that said, as I continue to work on various problems, and figure out the solutions needed to solve them, everything becomes a bit clearer.

I think part of the key to understanding is to really take a step back and clearly define how the application needs to work.  What aspects of the application need to tie together, what they need to output, where they need to direct you to, etc.

Before this, it was simply learning how to speak in Ruby.

Now, it's how to speak in Ruby, and how to really allow the program to speak to itelf, and all of its components in Ruby.

I remember started my coding journey with the basics of "Hello World!"

And here I am, learning the framework/concepts that allow for the complexities of Applications to work.

It's moments like these, where I can take a step back and really appreciate just how far I have come thus far.
