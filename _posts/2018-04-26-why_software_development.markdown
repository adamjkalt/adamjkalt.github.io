Having spent the better part of the last 15 years working in gyms, managing gyms, and running my own gym, pursuing a career in software development is certainly quite a change.  But, while, to an unassuming eye, it may appear completely out of left field, that really isn't the case.

I've always had a passing interest in technology, and my biggest regret from my time at Boston College was my chosen field of study.  It wasn't until a few years out of college that I realized I had missed the boat on pursuing software development.  But, as is so common in life, we get swept up my what is happening around us, our day to day lives, getting from one month to the next, and switching gears at that time in my life to pursue something completely different just didn't seem realistic or practical.

My future, or so I thought, was in the Fitness Industry.  I enjoyed it - I was interested in it- and so, to me, it made sense to continue to pursue it.

But over the years, I'd always go back and think about software development, coding, etc, as a "missed opportunity".  While I certainly had passion for the Fitness Industry, was it the thing that truly interested me most?  

Then, last year, I started wondering if maybe, what seemed to be less than practical, was actually quite practical after all.

And, what seemed to be unrealistic, well, perhaps it wasn't that unrealistic.

Maybe, these were just preconceived notions in my head - assumptions that weren't so much based in reality, but in my own fears of making a change.

So, while still running my business, I started doing some research.  I had friends in the industry - so there was certainly an opportunity to talk to people who had walked and were walking a path that I was interested in.  The more I researched, and the more I learned, the more I realized that I really could pursue this, learn this, and make a career out of this.

Now, that's a lot of background - but not much substance to the question of "Why"?

While the scope of Software Development is vast, my initial interest revolves around the ability to "Create".

The idea that I can imagine something, have an "idea" about something, and can then create it through code is just amazing to me.  

I love that Coding is essentially Problem Solving.

You have something, anything you want to do or make happen, and you can construct it through code.  

And it's not limited to one genre.  Everyone uses products that are the result of code, and our reliance on technology is only growing.

I've never felt that anything I have ever learned had such "relevancy" to every day life as I do now.

To sum it up:

That feeling of "relevancy" and "application to every day life" is really what drew me to Software Development in the first place.
